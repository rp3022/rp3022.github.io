# This is Rhea Pawar's website

#### Welcome to my website!
I am a dentist from India and am currently in the 2nd year of the MPH program at [Mailman School Of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/).

This website was created by me to provide you with an insight of my academic background and professional experience.
It includes links for navigating to my GitHub account, LinkedIn and my email address. It also includes my Resume and a flexdashboard I created.


Here's a direct link to my [Resume](Resume.html)

Here's a direct link to the [Plotly flexdashboard](plotly.html)
