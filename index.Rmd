### Welcome to my website!
<img src="images/linkedin.jpeg" style="width:30%">

My career began as a dentist in India, where I gained two years of valuable clinical experience. However, I soon realized that my calling extended beyond the traditional boundaries of the dental profession. Driven by a passion to impact public health on a larger scale, I joined an NGO, which ultimately led me to pursue my Masters in Public Health with a focus in Epidemiology at [Mailman School Of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/) . As I progressed through the program, I discovered my aptitude for data analytics and eagerly pursued a certificate in biostatistics and healthcare data science. Armed with a diverse skill set and unique perspective from my clinical background, I am uniquely equipped to approach public health challenges from multiple angles.

Passionate about health equity and advancing research, my focus lies in leveraging statistical modeling and healthcare analysis to drive meaningful changes and improve population health outcomes. Through my expertise in statistical programming languages such as SAS and R Studio, I am adept at data manipulation and extracting valuable insights from large datasets to inform evidence-based decision making. I have a keen interest in exploring the intersection of epidemiology, biostatistics, and data science to address complex public health challenges.
